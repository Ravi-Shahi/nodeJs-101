# BASIC NODE APPS
Repository contains basics node app to advance node app. To use any of the app in repository just clone the app to local machine and execute:
```
cd {repo_folder}
cd {node app folders}
npm install
```

After doing this create a environment varaible file **_.env_** 
`touch .env`
and add **PORT** variable inside the file and run the application using nodemon command:
`nodemon app.js`
or
`npm run serve` 

Once server is up and running, you can access the app in browser.
